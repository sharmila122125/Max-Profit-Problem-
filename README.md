Max Profit Construction Optimizer

An interactive Streamlit web application that determines the most profitable sequence of constructing Theatres, Pubs, and Commercial Parks within a fixed time limit. The application evaluates all valid build permutations, computes earnings based on each building’s completion time, and identifies the optimal order that maximizes total revenue.
